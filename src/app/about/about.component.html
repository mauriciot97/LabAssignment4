                  <h2>My Biography</h2>
                  <p>Hello my name is Mauricio Torres. I was born on August 21, 1997 in Fresno, California. I am 22 years old and have lived in Fresno for my entire life.
                  I graduated from Fresno High School in 2015 with a 3.5GPA. I am currently a senior at California State University, Fresno. I am a Business Administration major
                  with a focus in Computer Information Systems.I plan on graduating in the spring of 2020. I have two cats,
                  one named Big Boy and the other Xenophilius. They were originally my sisters cats but I was asked to take care of them because she lives further away
                  from me. I enjoy playing games on my PC. My favorite video game genres are First-Person shooters and RPGs. I'm also fascinated with outer space and how vast it is. I'm a big fan of Mexican
                  and Chinese food. I like to watch documentaries of any kind since I find them interesting and educational. I also like to watch anime such as
                  My Hero Academia and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Thank you for taking the time to look at my site.
